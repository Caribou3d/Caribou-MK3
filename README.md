# Zaribo-MK3 Rel. 3.0

![Zaribo-MK3 Rel. 3.0](img/mk3full-web.png)


## Introduction

Welcome to the Zaribo github project page!

Zaribo 320 and Zaribo 220 are available as a full build or as a kit. You can also mod your Original Prusa printers to Zaribo 320 and Zaribo 220 with upgrade kits. Numbers are indicating the Z-Axis height. They are all featuring 3030 Aluminium Extrusions and improved plastic parts for rigidity, accuracy and speed. Both mods are almost identical except the Z-Axis motors and rods. You need longer lead screws for 320 build and you can buy identical quality stepper motors from Zaribo.com which have been used on the Original Prusa MK series.

Zaribo.com is the webshop for high-quality genuine parts you may need for your builds including heated beds, motors, screws, nuts, controller boards and even extruder springs.

Zaribo.com only sells tested, high-quality genuine items. Misumi is the best and most affordable vendor so far for hardware like rods and extrusions. Rock hardened rods are being cut with lathe precision. Aluminium extrusion cutting and drilling are precise and without sawdust.

You can also find the BOM for Zaribo 320 and 220 on Zaribo.com/blog

Special thanks to all our members for the contribution as the project is growing within an exceptionally friendly and courteous platform by our originator, caressing and smart members from all around the world. üôè

We give references that have influneced the design. Since the majority of plastic parts (even if much improved and somehow "new and different") have their roots in the initial design by Prusa Research we like to mention this a first and most influential reference.
